# 14/11 - 21/11

- Worked on the testbench for Lab 4.

# 28/11 - 3/12

- Worked on implementing the data memory as well as the multiplexer to choose whether we should output the ALU calculation or output the data stored at the memory location equal to the output of the ALU.
- Worked on debugging instruction memory as well as other modules within our single cycle processor

# 3/12 - 4/12

- Added the abillity for data memory to read external data.
- Created a test bench for data memory and tested it
- Ensured data memory was ready to be implemented 

# 6/12 - 10/12

- Created PDF test bench and started testing it with issues.
- Worked on fixing the test bench and understanding the issues with instruction memory size.
- Fixed testbench and ensured that pdf worked for both pipelined and single cycle processor
- Helped with general debugging for single cycle processor. 

# 10/12 - 12/12

- Helped with general testing and debugging with pipelining processor
